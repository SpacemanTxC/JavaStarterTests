# Java Interview Questions 
Two common questions found for developers starting out are FizzBuzz and Prime Numbers Detective. Here are my two attemps at this questions.<br/>

<h3>Fizz Buzz:</h3>
Fizz Buzz is a program that prints out number values 1 to 100. In the program I had to create a method that would print out fizz when the number was divisble of 3. If the value was divisble by 5 the program will print out Buzz. Finally, the program will print out FizzBuzz for values divible by 3 and 5.<br/>

<h3>Prime Number Detective:</h3> 

Prime Number Detective is a program that tests an array list of number values. The program is testing to see that numbers in the array are prime numbers. If the value is prime then the terminal will print out those value in the array.
